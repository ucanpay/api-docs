# Testing &amp; Sandbox Environment

## Overview

The UCanPay Testing and Sandbox environment is designed to provide a full-fledged testing platform that mimics the live
production environment. It allows developers to test their integration with UCanPay APIs without affecting real data or
incurring any transactions.

## Accessing the Sandbox

To access the Sandbox environment, you must first create a Sandbox account. Register
at `https://sandbox.ucanpay.ca/signup` to obtain your sandbox credentials, which will include a unique API key for
sandbox testing.

## Features

- **Full API Access:** The Sandbox environment supports all UCanPay API endpoints, enabling you to test every aspect of
  your integration.

- **Virtual Funds:** Transactions in the Sandbox do not require real money, and a virtual fund balance is provided for
  testing transaction flows.

- **Isolated Environment:** Activities in the Sandbox are completely isolated from production data, ensuring that your
  testing does not interfere with your live operations.

## Using the Sandbox

1. **Environment Switch:** Ensure that your API calls are directed to the Sandbox URL: `https://api.sandbox.ucanpay.ca`.

2. **API Credentials:** Utilize the API key and other credentials provided upon Sandbox registration for authentication.

3. **Test Data:** Utilize the provided test card numbers and payment details for transaction simulations.

4. **Testing Scenarios:** Simulate various payment, error, and refund scenarios as per your use case requirements.

5. **Results Verification:** Monitor and verify the transaction results within the Sandbox dashboard to confirm that the
   API behaves as expected.

## Best Practices

- **Testing Checklist:** Create a comprehensive list of test cases that cover all possible use cases and edge cases.

- **Automation:** Where possible, automate your test cases to efficiently run them with different parameters and inputs.

- **Performance Testing:** Simulate load on your application to understand how it performs under high traffic using the
  Sandbox.

- **Security Testing:** Verify that your application handles user data securely and in compliance with UCanPay's
  security standards.

- **Transition to Production:** Once testing is complete, carefully migrate to the production environment by updating
  the endpoint URLs and credentials.
