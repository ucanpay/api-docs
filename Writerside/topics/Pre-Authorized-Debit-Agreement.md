# Pre-Authorized Debit Agreement

This Authorization, known as Pre-Authorized Debits (PAD) Authorization, establishes a Pre-Authorized Debits request authority between "UCanPay®", "we", "us", or "our" (referring to Antario Digital Payment Services Inc. and its affiliates) and "you" or "your" (referring to each user of a UCanPay® E-Wallet Account).

## 1. Authorization
You warrant and guarantee that you are the person authorized to make withdrawals from the bank account (hereinafter "the Account") linked to your UCanPay® E-Wallet Account. You hereby authorize us to arrange for PADs to be drawn on the Account to settle transactions for your UCanPay® E-Wallet Account. UCanPay® may issue PADs in the amounts and with the frequency you authorize, up to a maximum of CAD$10,000 per transaction.

**You waive any requirement that UCanPay® give pre-notification of any payment amount or change of payment date.**

## 2. Adding / Cancellation
You may add the Account linked to your UCanPay® E-Wallet for PADs. Note that direct debiting may not be available for all accounts. You must ensure the Account can be debited and that any necessary arrangements with your financial institution are made to enable direct debiting.

You can cancel this Authorization at any time by removing the Account from your UCanPay® E-Wallet. Removing the Account does not cancel pending transfers already initiated and authorized.

## 3. Confirmation
We will provide written confirmation via email of this Authorization before the first PAD is debited from the Account. We will notify your financial institution about the amount and timing of payments in accordance with the instructions you have provided to us.

The first debit will occur on the debit day of the first transaction entered with us following acceptance of this Authorization.

## 4. Validation by Financial Institution
Your financial institution is not required to verify that a PAD has been issued in accordance with the terms of this Authorization.

## 5. Contract for Goods & Services
Revocation of this Authorization does not terminate any contract for goods or services that exists between you and any UCanPay® Merchant or UCanPay®.

## 6. Payment Service Provider
We may use a third party as our payment processing representative for the transactions contemplated by this authorization. Information in this Authorization may be disclosed to third parties in accordance with our Privacy Policy and as required to complete any PAD transaction.

## 7. Disputes
Check your Account statement regularly. If you believe a PAD was not drawn in accordance with this Authorization or if amounts were withdrawn after you revoked this Authorization, contact us immediately.

## 8. Recourse / Reimbursement
You have recourse rights if any PAD does not comply with this Authorization. You have the right to receive reimbursement for any PAD that you have not authorized or that is not consistent with this Authorization. For more information on your recourse rights, contact your financial institution or visit Payments Canada.

## 9. Confidentiality
UCanPay® takes measures to protect the privacy of your personal information. We will disclose information about you only as specifically required by law or for the purposes of this Authorization and the UCanPay® E-Wallet User Agreement.
