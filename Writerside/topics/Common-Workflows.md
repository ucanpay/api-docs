# Common Workflows

## Overview

This section provides guidance on common workflows to help you integrate your application with UCanPay services efficiently. These workflows encompass typical scenarios you might encounter and provide step-by-step processes to handle them.

## Workflow 1: Customer Payment Process

### Steps:
1. **Create Payment Order**: Initiate a payment request by creating an order on your system and then calling the UCanPay `Create Payment` API endpoint.
2. **Customer Authorization**: Redirect the customer to UCanPay for payment authorization using the payment session ID received.
3. **Payment Confirmation**: On successful payment, UCanPay will redirect the customer back to your specified URL with a payment confirmation.
4. **Verify Payment**: Make an API call to UCanPay to verify the payment status using the order ID.

## Workflow 2: Refund Processing

### Steps:
1. **Refund Request**: Send a refund request to UCanPay using the `Refund` API endpoint with the original payment ID and the refund amount.
2. **Refund Verification**: Poll the `Refund Status` API endpoint or set up a webhook to receive notifications on the refund status.
3. **Notify Customer**: Update the customer about the refund status via email or through your application interface.

## Workflow 3: Recurring Payments

### Steps:
1. **Setup Subscription**: Create a subscription plan using UCanPay and associate it with the customerâ€™s account.
2. **Payment Collection**: UCanPay will automatically collect payments based on the subscription plan cycle.
3. **Renewal and Notifications**: Handle subscription renewal notifications and payment success/failure as per the subscription plan.

## Workflow 4: Handling Payment Failures

### Steps:
1. **Detect Failure**: Listen for payment failure notifications via the UCanPay API or webhook.
2. **Error Logging**: Log the error details and analyze the cause of the failure.
3. **Customer Notification**: Inform the customer about the failure and provide options for retrying the payment.
