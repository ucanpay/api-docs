# Versioning &amp; Updates

UCanPay API adheres to a strict versioning policy to ensure backward compatibility and minimize disruptions to your
applications. This page details our approach to API versioning, how you can manage updates, and what changes you can
expect in the future.

## API Versioning Strategy

Our versioning strategy is designed to provide stability and predictability:

<procedure title="Understanding Our Versioning Strategy" id="versioning-strategy">
    <step>
        <p>We use semantic versioning (SemVer) for our API. Versions are formatted as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.</p>
    </step>
    <step>
        <p><format style="bold">Major releases</format> may introduce breaking changes that could affect existing integrations. They are communicated well in advance.</p>
    </step>
    <step>
        <p><format style="bold">Minor releases</format> add new features but do not break existing functionality.</p>
    </step>
    <step>
        <p><format style="bold">Patch releases</format> include bug fixes and minor changes that do not affect the API's external behavior.</p>
    </step>
</procedure>

## Managing API Updates

To ensure a smooth transition between versions, follow these guidelines:

**Subscribe to Update Notifications**

Stay informed about upcoming releases and changes by subscribing to our API newsletter. You will receive update
notifications and detailed release notes.

**Testing with Sandbox Environment**

Before deploying new versions in your production environment, test them in our sandbox environment to ensure
compatibility.

## Update Schedule

UCanPay follows a regular update schedule to keep our services secure and efficient:

- **Major Updates:** Scheduled annually, with preliminary release notes provided six months in advance.
- **Minor Updates:** Occur quarterly and include new features and enhancements.
- **Patch Updates:** Deployed as needed, typically monthly, to address urgent issues.
