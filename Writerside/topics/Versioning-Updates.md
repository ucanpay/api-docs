# Versioning &amp; Updates

UCanPay API adheres to a strict versioning policy to ensure backward compatibility and minimize disruptions to your applications. This page details our approach to API versioning, how you can manage updates, and what changes you can expect in the future.

## API Versioning Strategy

Our versioning strategy is designed to provide stability and predictability:

<procedure title="Understanding Our Versioning Strategy" id="versioning-strategy">
    <step>
        <p>We use semantic versioning (SemVer) for our API. Versions are formatted as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.</p>
    </step>
    <step>
        <p>**Major releases** may introduce breaking changes that could affect existing integrations. They are communicated well in advance.</p>
    </step>
    <step>
        <p>**Minor releases** add new features but do not break existing functionality.</p>
    </step>
    <step>
        <p>**Patch releases** include bug fixes and minor changes that do not affect the API's external behavior.</p>
    </step>
</procedure>
